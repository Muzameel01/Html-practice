    <p>London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just under 9
    million.[1] It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down to the
    North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9] The City of London, its ancient core and financial
    centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 1][10] The City of
    Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries hosted the national government and parliament.
    Since the 19th century,[11] the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically
    split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which largely comprises Greater
    London,[13] governed by the Greater London Authority.[note 2][14]

    As one of the world's major global cities,[15] London exerts a strong influence on its arts, entertainment, fashion,
    commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism, and transport and
    communications.[16][17] Its GDP (€801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the largest urban economy in Europe,[18] and it
    is one of the major financial centres in the world. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education
    institutions,[19] it is home to some of the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world—Imperial College
    London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive
    University College London.[20][21] London is the most visited city in Europe and has the busiest city airport system
    in the world.[22] The London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.[23] London is home to the
    most 5-star hotels of any city.[24]

    London's diverse cultures encompass over 300 languages.[25] The mid-2018 population of Greater London of about 9
    million[26] made it Europe's third-most populous city,[27] accounting for 13.4% of the population of the United
    Kingdom[28] and over 16% of the population of England. The Greater London Built-up Area is the fourth-most populous
    in Europe with about 9.8 million inhabitants at the 2011 census.[29][30] The London metropolitan area is the
    third-most populous in Europe with about 14 million inhabitants in 2016,[note 3][5][31] granting London the status
    of a megacity.</p>
